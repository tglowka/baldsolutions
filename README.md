# 1. Introduction
This repository is meant to be the storage of the code examples related to the [baldsolution](https://baldsolutions.com/) blog's posts. The blog consists of posts focused mainly on the .NET-specific topics. Nonetheless, I plan to write about other stuff that I find interesting as well.

# 2. Repositry structure
Each directory is related to the particular blog's category. For now there are following blog's categories:
 - .NET

## 2.1 Categories
Each category (e.g. .NET) consists of the code examples. Inside a category directories' names are tightly coupled with the particular posts. For example `.NET/async-eliding-part-1*` projects are only related to the [Async eliding, part 1 â€“ benefits](https://baldsolutions.com/index.php/2022/01/30/async-eliding-part-1-benefits/) post.
