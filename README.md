# 1. Introduction
The main goal of the repository is to store code examples related to the [baldsolution](https://baldsolutions.com/) blog posts. The blog posts focused mainly on the .NET topics. Nonetheless, I plan to write about other stuff that I find interesting as well.

# 2. Categories
Most of the subdirectories consist of the code examples related to the blog posts. For example `.net/async-eliding-part-1*` are related to the [Async eliding, part 1 â€“ benefits](https://baldsolutions.com/index.php/2022/01/30/async-eliding-part-1-benefits/) post.
