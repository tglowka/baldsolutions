# 1. Introduction

Moving Target Defence (MTD) is an active defence principle that is focsued on dynamic attack surface modifications.

The following project is a PoC that shows how the MTD could be implemented.

# 2. How does it work?
The implementation of the MTD consists of the following questions' answers:
- What? -> specifies what part of attack surface will be dymanically modified,
- How? -> specifies how the dynamic modifications will be applied,
- When? -> specifies when the dynamic modification will be applied.

The PoC answers are as follows:
- What? - services` locations (port numbers),
- How? - [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page) rules that redirect network traffic, 
- When? - every T seconds, where ```L <= T <= U```, L and U are provided at program startup.

# 3. Architecture
The PoC consists of four docker containers: \

The `bad-nmap` container is an untrusted and bad actor and is used to scan the network, namely `nftables` container. On the other hand, the `good-nmap` container is a trusted and good actor that is also used to scan the network. `nftables` container hosts the PoC that applies [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page) rules to redirect network traffic and mislead adversaries (`bad-nmap` container). `nftables` container also hosts an application that is able to send messages to the `redis` container. The PoC subscribes redis topic and each message triggers nftables rules application. Moreover, the `nftables` container has 5 open tcp ports: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

# 4. Test the solution

To test the solution a linux based machine with a docker compose is required. 

The PoC is configured to mislead the `bad-nmap` container so that the services listening on `nftables` machine, port numbers: 3, 4, 5, are "moving" from the `bad-nmap` container point of view. Ports 1 and 2 stand still in that scenario (this could be changed in the `configuration.json` file but for the sake of simplicity let's focus on the presented test scenario).  

## 4.1 Run the PoC

Open first terminal and run:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

`bad-nmap` and `good-nmap` containers exited immediately but we will take care of it in a moment.

## 4.2 Bad and Good Nmap

Open second terminal and run:
```
sudo docker-compose run bad-nmap
```

`bad-nmap` and `good-nmap` containers have [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) tool installed - a powerful network discovery tool.

From inside the `bad-nmap` container run the [SYN](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html) scan against `nftables` container, ports 1...20:
```
nmap -sS 10.0.0.2 -p1-20
```
or
```
nmap -sS nftables -p1-20
```
Both IP and container name (`nftables`) are valid as communication within a docker network could be done by using containers names. Output should look like this: \
<img src="./pic/nmap-syn-scan.png" width="400">

As you can see the scan tells us that there are 5 TCP ports open: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

Open third terminal and run:
```
sudo docker-compose run good-nmap
```
From inside the `good-nmap` container run the [SYN](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html) scan against `nftables` container, ports 1...20:
```
nmap -sS 10.0.0.2 -p1-20
```
or
```
nmap -sS nftables -p1-20
```
You should see similar results to the previous scan (`bad-nmap` container scan) - 5 TCP ports open: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

## 4.3 Nftables

Open fourth terminal and run:
```
sudo docker-compose exec nftables sh
```

`nftables` (as mentioned in the [architecture](#3-architecture) section), has a python app that is able to send messages to the `redis` container. To send a single message run:
```
python3 -m redis-message-launcher.main -r 10.0.0.5
```
or
```
python3 -m redis-message-launcher.main -r redis
```
Once you send the message, you should see that the `nftables` container received the message (first terminal). Receiving the message means that the nftables rules have been applied. To verify let's run the SYN scan one more time (second terminal - `bad nmap` container):
```
nmap -sS nftables -p1-20
```

<img src="./pic/nmap-syn-scan-2.png" width="400">

This time the scan tells us that there are 5 ports open: 1, 2, 6, 10, 16 (in your case the open ports apart from 1 and 2 will probably differ as they are randomly chosen). It means that nftables rules have been applied and the network traffic is redirected according to the PoC logic.

Let's run another message (fourth terminal - `nftables` container
```
python3 -m redis-message-launcher.main -r redis
```

and SYN scan one more time (second terminal - `bad-nmap` container):

```
nmap -sS nftables -p1-20
```
You should see that the ports (apart from port 1 and 2) are moving!

Now run the same scan but from the third terminal (good and trusted `good-nmap` container)
```
nmap -sS nftables -p1-20
```
As you can see the open ports from the `good-nmap` container point of view are still the same despite the fact that the `bad-container` sees something completely different.

## 4.4 Automate messages sending
Insted of sending messages one by one you can run python app and send messages in intervals (fourth container - `nftables` container):
```
python3 -m redis-message-launcher.main -l 20 -u 25 -r redis
```
These additional `-l` and `-u` params mean that messages will be sent every T seconds, where ```l <= T <= u```. To interrupt the program just CTRL+C (ignore an error...).

## 4.5 Other scans
The PoC can mislead other types of Nmap TCP scans:
- [FIN](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html),
- [NULL](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html),
- [XMAS](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html),
- [Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html).

To run the scans simply replace `-sS` in Nmap commands with the following:
- FIN -> `-sF`,
- NULL -> `-sN`,
- XMAS -> `-sX`,
- Connect Scan -> `-sT` (Don't worry if the first terminal prints errors for this scan - that's because the scan immediately terminates the established connection. The PoC and open ports should work fine.).

## 4.6 Kill the PoC
Once you test the PoC you can stop the containers by running `exit` in the terminals and run:
```
sudo docker-compose down -v
```
in one of them.
